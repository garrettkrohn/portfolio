## Terminal Emulator
A terminal emulator is essentially the application that you use to interact
with your machine.  Apple has a Terminal application that is pretty basic and 
there are better options out there.  My top choice recently has been alacritty
for a the following reasons:

1. Alacritty is crazy fast.  I noticed a difference immediately in my workflow
2. I use Tmux for all of my tab management, so I didn't need the feature(s) from iterm2
3. Much like Josh Medeski, I have been trying to move to a more minimal setup
4. Speaking of minimal, I really love that you can configure Alacritty with a single yaml file

### Alacritty config

`.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`
```yaml

    white: "#ebdbb2"
```

### Other options
I used Iterm2 for quite a while and it was great.  It has
some native support for things like Tabs and Panes, so if 
you aren't using tmux, iterm could be a good option

I haven't had experience with it but Kitty is another
option that I see discussed frequently.
