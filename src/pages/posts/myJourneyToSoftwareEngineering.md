## What do you want to be when you grow up? 
Both of my parents were band directors growing up and so it is probably
no surprise that I grew up wanting to do the same. While finishing my
Undergraduate Degree in Music Education, I really fell in love with 
performing music and I decided to pursue a Master's degree in music
performance. I thought higher education was so much fun that I decided
to go get a Doctorate as well.

During my doctoral studies I learned and performed contemporary music
focusing on pieces that unite acousic instruments and technology. My 
dissertation covered pieces that were written for Horn and live computer
interaction. 

## 10 years of college done, now what?

For anyone considering going to college for 10 years, let me save you some
time and say just don't do it. I really loved it, honestly until I got 
married. When I was a bachelor it was really great just studying and 
performing music, but there's more to life than that.

> Don't go to college for 10 years - me

While working on my dissertation, I taught at a private school for a year
then worked at a church doing music technology. During this time I decided
it was time for a career change. My wife and I had just had our first child,
and I needed to find a career I could really dig into and have some upward
mobility.  I have a brother in law who was a Software Engineer and every 
time I talked to him I left the conversation thinking that I would love it 
and do well at it.

In January 2022, I began to explore coding more seriously.  I took an intro
to Java course to see if I liked programming.  Why did I pick Java?  No idea.
The course was great and I quickly decided that it was a really great fit.

### Time for a Bootcamp

In March of 2022, I decided that I needed to do a bootcamp to try to get into
the industry. I've been asked if it was worth it, and I certainly have mixed
feelings on it that will be another post someday. What's important though, is
that it got me my first job.

## Software Engineer at Kipsu

Before I finished my bootcamp, I ended up getting hired at a mature start-up 
company called Kipsu and I've been working there since.  It's been a great
company and I'm so thankful that I have had the opportunity.
