## What do you want to be when you grow up? 
Both of my parents were band directors growing up and so it is probably
no surprise that I grew up wanting to do the same. While finishing my
Undergraduate Degree in Music Education, I really fell in love with 
performing music and I decided to pursue a Master's degree in music
performance. I thought higher education was so much fun that I decided
to go get a Doctorate as well.

During my doctoral studies I learned and performed contemporary music
focusing on pieces that unite acousic instruments and technology. My 
dissertation covered pieces that were written for Horn and live computer
interaction. 

## 10 Years of College, Now What?

For anyone considering going to college for 10 years, let me save you some
time and say just don't do it. I really loved it, honestly until I got 
married. When I was a bachelor it was really great just studying and 
performing music, but there's more to life than that.

> Don't go to college for 10 years

While working on my dissertation, I taught at a private school for a year
then worked at a church doing music technology. During this time I decided
it was time for a career change. My wife and I had just had our first child,
and I needed to find a career I could really dig into and have some upward
mobility.  I have a brother-in-law who was a Software Engineer and every 
time I talked to him about what he was doing, I left the conversation thinking
that I would love it and do well at it.

## Taking the Leap

I began to explore coding more seriously as I contemplated a career change 
starting with a Java course on Udemy to see if I felt like it was a good fit.
That eventually led to taking a Java bootcamp which got me my first job in
the industry at a startup called Kipsu.  We do digital messaging primarily
for hotels.  If you've every gotten a text from a hotel welcoming you, we
were probably the company who made that happen.

I have been at Kipsu for almost a year and a half at the time of writting 
this and I have become particularly passionate about neovim and my terminal
based development workflow.  I also really enjoy writting and sharing what
I've learned, so I hope you enjoy the content on this site!
